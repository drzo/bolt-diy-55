# Electron Build Issues for Windows

## Issue Analysis

When attempting to build the Electron Windows app for Bolt DIY, we encountered several issues:

1. **Memory Issues**
   - The build process ran out of memory when building the renderer part
   - Even with increased Node.js memory allocation (`--max-old-space-size=8192`), the build failed

2. **Environment Issues**
   - Windows PowerShell execution policy restrictions
   - Bash script issues in Windows environment
   - PowerShell syntax differences (e.g., `&&` vs `;`)

3. **Build Steps**
   - The build process requires multiple steps:
     - `electron:build:renderer` - Build the Remix/React frontend
     - `electron:build:deps` - Build the main process and preload scripts
     - `electron:build:win` - Package the app for Windows

## Recommendations

1. **Memory Optimization**
   - Consider splitting the build process into smaller chunks
   - Optimize the Vite build configuration to use less memory

2. **Environment Setup**
   - Use proper Windows environment setup
   - Install required build tools properly:
     - Visual Studio Build Tools
     - Windows 10 SDK
     - Python 2.7 (for node-gyp)

3. **Build Process**
   - Create a specialized Windows build script that accounts for PowerShell differences
   - Consider using cross-platform build tools like `cross-env`

## Next Steps

1. Review the electron-builder configuration for Windows-specific options
2. Set up appropriate code signing for Windows
3. Test build with a reduced feature set to find problematic components
4. Implement the persona customization feature after resolving build issues
