# Fixing Electron Build Memory Issues

## Problem
Memory issues during the Windows build process using the `.bat` file caused the build to fail, particularly during the renderer build phase. The user mentioned that previously `.os1` files worked instead of the `.bat` files.

## Analysis
- The `build-electron-win.bat` file had insufficient memory allocation (only 4GB)
- The build process was not optimized for memory usage
- Windows batch scripts have limitations compared to PowerShell

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Batch File
Updated `build-electron-win.bat` with:
- Increased memory allocation to 8GB
- Added a pause between build steps to allow garbage collection
- Used cross-env for consistent environment variable handling

### 2. PowerShell Alternative
Created `build-electron-win.ps1` with:
- Better memory management
- Colorized output for better readability
- ExecutionPolicy bypass parameter in the npm script

### 3. Stepped Build Process
Created `build-electron-win-steps.ps1` with:
- Explicit garbage collection between steps
- Different memory allocations for different build phases
- Proper cleanup between steps

### 4. Package.json Scripts
Added new npm scripts:
- `electron:build:win:ps`: For the PowerShell build
- `electron:build:win:steps`: For the stepped build process

## Usage
To build the Electron app for Windows with improved memory handling:
```bash
# Best option for memory issues
pnpm run electron:build:win:steps
```

## Next Steps
1. Test the build process with the new scripts
2. Set up the proper Windows build environment
3. Proceed with adding the persona customization interface
